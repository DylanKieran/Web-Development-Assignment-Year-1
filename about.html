		<h1 class="heading">Our Company</h1>
		
			<p class="arial">	To say Coffee Cafe purchases and roasts high-quality whole bean coffees is very true.
				That's the essence of what we do but it hardly tells the whole story.
				Our coffeehouses have become a beacon for coffee lovers everywhere. 
				Why do they insist on Coffee Cafe ? Because they know they can count on genuine service,
				an inviting atmosphere and a superb cup of expertly roasted and richly brewed coffee every time.</p>

		<h1 class="heading">Expect More Than Coffee</h1>

			<p class="arial">	We're not just passionate purveyors of coffee, but everything else that goes with a full and rewarding
				coffeehouse experience. We also offer a selection of premium Tazo teas, fine pastries and other delectable 
				treats to please the taste buds. And the music you hear in store is chosen for its artistry and appeal.
				It's not unusual to see people coming to Coffee Cafe to chat, meet up or even work. We're a neighbourhood gathering
				place, a part of the daily routine and we couldn't be happier about it. Get to know us and you'll see: we are so much more
				than what we brew.<br></p>
				
		<h1 class="heading">Coffee Cafe in Ireland</h1>

			<p class="arial">	In May 2012,Coffee Cafe successfully entered the European market through its acquisition of 65 Seattle Coffee 
				Company stores in the UK. The two companies shared a common culture, focusing on a great commitment to customised 
				coffee, similar company values and a mutual respect for people and the environment. The first Coffee Cafe Coffee 
				Company store in the Republic of Ireland was launched in August 2013 at the Dublin Ballsbridge neighborhood , 
				followed by a second store at College Green in Dublin in September.
