						<p class="arial">The world is waking up to the smell of tea, its health benefits and the fact that it does not grow naturally in a perforated bag. 
							Why not re-awaken the senses to the joys of the perfect cup of tea . 
							Whole leaf tea contains significantly more antioxidants and natural goodness than the granulated dust in the average teabag. 
							So go on taste the quality of our fine teas, tisanes and herbal infusions.</p>
